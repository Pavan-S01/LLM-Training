The app.py file contains the code to run create a chatbot on chainlit that uses the LLMs present in the LLMOps classroom deployments to generate a response. The original idea was to create a chatbot that asks the user to upload a pdf and then chunk the pdf and store the embeddings in a Pinecone vector store and then use that data as context to generate responses but attempts to connect with Pinecone always resulted in some SSL error that I can't fix so that code has been commented out. I also tried to integrate the Phoenix library but the installations kept failing on my local system due to some error related to a dependant library 'hdbscan' that I am unable to fix even by manaully installing any dependencies. So this app.py file can only return responses generated without context.
